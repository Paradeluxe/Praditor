# How to use _Praditor_?

Although I have prepared various buttons in this GUI, you do not have to use them all.

The simplest and easiest procedure is (1) import audio files, (2) hit the `extract` button,
(3) [optional] you are not happy about the results, fine-tune the parameters and hit the `extract` button again. 
**Until you are happy about the results, repeat step (2) and (3).**

## General

### import audio file(s)

`File` -> `Read files...` -> Select your target audio file

_Note_. All the other audio files will also be added to the list.


### run algorithm and extract onsets

Hit `Extract`. Wait for a while until the results come out. Onsets are in blue, offsets are in green.


### play and stop üíø

Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to play the audio signal that is currently presented in the window. 

Press <kbd>any key</kbd> to stop playing.



### go to the next/previous audio file

Hit `Next`/`Prev`.

## .TextGrid related


### I wanna temporarily clear the annotations

Hit `Clear`. This does not delete/change the .TextGrid file. It's safe.

### Oh no, I want the cleared annotations back

Hit `Read`. _Praditor_ will go back to the .TextGrid and present whatever is in it.

### Hide/Show annotations

Press `Onset`/`Offset` (sometimes they are the number of Onsets/Offsets). 

## Parameters 

`Current/Default` Display default parameters or parameters for the current file

`Save` Save the displayed parameters as Current/Default

`Reset` Reset the displayed parameters to the last time you saved it.

# Quick instruction

**Basically, all you need to know is here.**

_Praditor_ employs 9 parameters divided into two functional categories: (1) **Denoising** and (2) **Defining** parameters. 
The latter establishes onset definitions, while the former eliminates noise that might compromise Praditor's algorithmic performance.


## Denoising Parameters
(LowPass, HighPass, KernelSize, KernelFrm%)

### 1. Bandpass Filtering (First Stage)
- _**LowPass**_ (int, Hz): High cutoff frequency
- _**HighPass**_ (int, Hz): Low cutoff frequency

All recordings contain inherent noise to some extent. 
Our focus lies specifically on noise that impacts Praditor's performance.
You should prioritize frequency bands exhibiting higher energy/amplitude contrast near onsets. 
Removing low-contrast frequency bands is supposed to enhance annotation accuracy and precision.

### 2. Kernel Smoothing (Second Stage, During Scanning)
- **_KernelFrm%_** (float): Percentage of frames retained in kernel window (e.g., 0.97 = discard top 3% frames by absolute value)
- **_KernelSize_** (int, frame): Kernel window size in frames (e.g., 100 = 100-frame window)

We need, and only need, the trend of the audio signal to tell where the onset is, instead of the spiky ups and downs (i.e., high frequency components).
What the kernel smoothing does here is to remove the spiky part and keep the trend of audio signal.

## Definition Parameters
(Threshold, CountValid, Penalty, RefLen, EPS%)

### 1. Number of onsets
- **_EPS%_** (float): Radius ratio calculated from the 80th percentile of absolute amplitudes

Praditor's unique multi-onset detection capability derives from DBSCAN clustering pre-thresholding.
This technique identifies potential onset regions through density-based separation:
(1) Background noise forms dense clusters near the coordinate origin;
(2) Speech signals create sparse clusters away from the origin.

The EPS% parameter optimizes boundary delineation between clusters. 
Increased EPS% incorporates transitional data points (e.g., pauses during utterance), while decreased values exclude them from onset annotations.

### 2. Thresholding Parameters
* **_RefLen_** (int, frame): Reference signal length for baseline calculation
* **_Threshold_** (float, >1.0): Amplitude coefficient (baseline √ó coefficient = actual threshold)
* **_CountValid_** (int) Onset qualification standard (valid count = above-threshold frames - [below-threshold frames √ó penalty])
* **_Penalty_** (float, >1.0): Weight applied to below-threshold frames

With DBSCAN clustering, we are able to pinpoint all the silence segments. But it is the boundaries between silence and sound segments that we care about, right? So, what we do to search for each of these boundaries is: 

(1) We can generate a baseline by determine a reference segment (with RefLen parameter) that is totally inside a silence segment, which follows a basic principle that ‚ÄúBackground noise is baseline‚Äù. 

(2) We time the baseline with a coefficient, Threshold parameter. It is mostly of time around 1.3, but has to be larger than 1.0 at least, because another principle we follow here is ‚ÄúSound should be louder than the background noise/silence‚Äù. 

(3) We set frames that come after the reference segment as onset candidate and check their validity by scanning frames after them. Above-threshold frames count as +1, and below-threshold frames count as -1 multiplied by Penalty parameter. The penalty parameter acts as a sensitivity control: higher values increase rejection of onset candidates containing silent intervals (e.g., inter-word pauses), while lower values permit greater tolerance. We add these values up one by one until one of the two situations is met. If the number hits CountValid parameter, then this onset candidate is determined as an actual onset; if it becomes less or equal to zero, we move on to the next onset candidate.








# How does _Praditor_ work?
The audio signal is first band-pass filtered to remove some high/low frequency noise. 
Then, it is down sampled with max-pooling strategy (i.e., using the max value to represent each piece).

![ds_maxp.png](instructions/ds_maxp.png)

DBSCAN requires two dimensions. How do we transform 1-D audio signal into 2-D array?
For every two consecutive pieces, they are grouped into a **point**. The point has two dimensions, previous and next frame.
On this point array, Praditor applies DBSCAN clustering to these points. 
Noise points are usually gathered around (0, 0) due to their relatively small amplitudes.

![DBSCAN_small.png](instructions/DBSCAN_small.png)

At this point, noise areas are found, which means we have roughly pinpoint the probable locations of onsets (i.e., target area).

We do not continue to use the original amplitudes, but first derivatives. First-derivative thresholding is a common technique
in other signal processing areas (e.g., ECG). It keeps the trend but remove the noisy ("spiky") part, which helps to improve the performance.

![scan.png](instructions/scan.png)

For every target area, we do the same procedure as below:
1. Set up a noise reference. It's **mean absolute first-derivatives** as baseline.
2. Set up a **starting frame** as the onset candidate (start from the very next frame from the noise reference).
3. Scan from the starting frame. We use **kernel smoothing** to see if the current frame (or actually kernel/window) is **valid/invalid**.
4. When we gather enough **valid** frames, the exact frame/time point we stop is the answer we want. Otherwise, we move on to the next starting frame.

# Parameters
## HighPass/LowPass
Before we apply down sampling and clustering to the audio signal, a band pass filter is first applied to the original signal.
The idea is that we do not need all the frequencies. Too high and too low frequency band can be contaminated. 

![choose_freq.png](instructions/choose_freq.png)

What we need is the middle part that has high contrast between silence and sound.

Be reminded that the **_LowPass_** should not surpass the highest valid frequency (half of the sample rate, refer to _Nyquist theorem_).

## EPS%

DBSCAN clustering requires two parameters: **EPS** and **MinPt**. What DBSCAN does is to scan every point, take it as the circle center, 
and draw a circle with a radius **EPS** in length. Within that circle, calculate how many points within and count them valid if hit **MinPt**.

![DBSCAN.png](instructions/DBSCAN.png)

Praditor allows user to adjust **_EPS%_**. Since every audio file can have different amplitude level/silence-sound contrast,
Praditor determines **EPS = Current Audio's Largest Amplitude * _EPS%_**.

## RefLen
After Praditor has confirmed target areas, the original amplitudes is the transformed into absolute first-derivatives. 
For each target area, Praditor would set up a _Reference Area_, whose mean value serves as the baseline for later thresholding.

![reflen.png](instructions/reflen.png)

The length of this reference area is determined by _**RefLen**_. 
When you want to capture silence that has very short length, it is better that you turn down _**RefLen**_ a little bit as well.


## Threshold
It is the most used parameter. The core idea of thresholding method is about "Hitting the cliff".
Whenever a talker speaks, the (absolute) amplitude rises up and creates a "cliff" (in amplitude, or other features).

![threshold_possibly_close.png](instructions/threshold_possibly_close.png)

**_Threshold_** has a minimum limitation at **1.00**, which is based on the mean value of background-noise reference.
However, background noise is not "smoothy" but actually "spiky". 
That is why **_Threshold_** is usually **slightly larger than 1.00**.

![asp_sound.png](instructions/asp_sound.png)

Besides, I would suggest you pay more attention to **aspirated sound**, as this type of sound has "very slow slope". 
Too large **_Threshold_** can end up in the middle of that "slope" (which is something you don't want). 
If that's the case, it can sound really weird, like a burst, rather than gradually smooth in.

## KernelSize, KernelFrm%
After reference area and threshold are set, Praditor will (1) set up a starting frame (2) begin scan frame by frame (starting from the frame right next to ref area). 
It will repeat this process until the valid starting frame (i.e., onset) is found.

Usually we would compare the value (absolute 1st derivative) with threshold. If it surpasses, we call it **valid**; if not, then **invalid**.
But, Praditor does it a little bit differently, using **kernel smoothing**.
Praditor would borrow information from later frames, like setting up a window (kernel) with a length, **_KernelSize_**.

![kernel.png](instructions/kernel.png)

To prevent extreme values, Praditor would neglect the first few largest values in the window (kernel). Or, we only retain 
**_KernelFrm%_** of all frames (e.g., 80% of all).
If there is actually extreme values, then we successfully avoid them; if not, then it would not hurt since they are
among other values at similar level.


## CountValid, Penalty
**How do we say an onset is an onset?** After that onset, lots of frames are **above threshold consecutively**.

Just as mentioned above, as Praditor scans frame by frame (window by window, or kernel by kernel), each frame is either going to be **above** or **below** the threshold. 
If the current frame (kernel) surpass the threshold, then it's **valid** and  counted as **+1**; 
If it fails to surpass, then it's **invalid** and counted as **-1 * _Penalty_**. 


Then, Praditor adds them up to get a **sum**. 
Whenever the **sum** hits zero or below zero, the scanning aborts, and we move on to the next starting frame.
On other words, we only want a starting frame whose **scanning sum stays positive**. 

**_Penalty_** here is like a "knob" for tuning **noise sensitivity**. **Higher** **_Penalty_** means higher sensitivity to **below-threshold frames.**

![count_valid.png](instructions/count_valid.png)

In summary, each scan has a starting frame (i.e., onset candidate). What we do is to check if this "starting frame" is "valid". 
By saying it "valid", we are saying that scanning sum stays positive and hits **_CountValid_** in the end.

Then, we can say, this is the exact **time point (onset/offset)** we want.

## From Authors
Praditor is a **speech onset detector** that automatically detects all the possible boundaries between silence and sound sections.

If you have any questions in terms of how to use Praditor or its algorithm details,
feel free to contact me at `zhengyuan.liu@connect.um.edu.mo` or `paradeluxe3726@gmail.com`.

I'm new to GitHub and still learning how to use it. Please forgive me if there is something I missed. Thx XD

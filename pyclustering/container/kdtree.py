    @brief   Represents KD Tree that is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing points

    @details In the term k-d tree, k denotes the dimensionality of the space being represented. Each data point is
              represented as a node in the k-d tree in the form of a record of type node. The tree supports
              dynamic construction when nodes can be dynamically added and removed. As a result KD-tree might not be
              balanced if methods `insert` and `remove` are used to built the tree. If the tree is built using
              constructor where all points are passed to the tree then balanced tree is built. Single point search and
              range-search procedures have complexity is `O(n)` in worse case in case of unbalanced tree.
              If there is no need to build dynamic KD-tree, then it is much better to use static KD-tree
              `kdtree_balanced`.

        # Read data from text file
        sample = read_sample(SIMPLE_SAMPLES.SAMPLE_SIMPLE3);
        
        # Create instance of KD-tree and initialize (fill) it by read data.
        # In this case the tree is balanced.
        tree_instance = kdtree(sample);
        
        # Search for nearest point
        search_distance = 0.3;
        nearest_node = tree_instance.find_nearest_dist_node([1.12, 4.31], search_distance);
        
        # Search for nearest point in radius 0.3
        nearest_nodes = tree_instance.find_nearest_dist_nodes([1.12, 4.31], search_distance);
        print("Nearest nodes:", nearest_nodes);

    In case of building KD-tree using `insert` and `remove` method, the output KD-tree might be unbalanced - here

        kdtree_visualizer(tree_instance).visualize()

        # Build tree using `insert` only - unbalanced tree will be built.
